     My favorite book is "One Indian Girl" by Chetan Bhagat, a compelling exploration of modern Indian society through the eyes of its protagonist, Radhika. 
       The novel intricately weaves her personal and professional struggles, addressing societal expectations, gender norms, and the pursuit of individual dreams.
         Chetan Bhagat's narrative skill captures the complexities of a woman's journey, offering a thought-provoking commentary on contemporary issues with a perfect blend of humor and depth.
          This female-centric novel not only entertains but also prompts reflection on evolving societal dynamics.
             Its exploration of feminism and identity makes it a standout piece in contemporary Indian literature.

            Sanam Teri Kasam is among my best films.
            The movie looks at issues like love, giving, and conformity to social norms.
             As the protagonists work through difficulties and roadblocks in their relationship, the audience is taken on an emotional rollercoaster. 
            "I swear by you, my beloved," is how the movie's title "Sanam Teri Kasam" conveys the deep and enduring quality of the love it portrays.

    <h3>Code snippet</h3>
    With Python's built-in json module, reading data from a JSON file is a simple operation. 
    Importing the json module into your script is the first step.
     After importation, use the open() function in a with statement to open the JSON file.
      This guarantees that, after reading, the file is correctly closed. 
    The JSON file's content should then be loaded into a Python data structure—a dictionary or list is a common choice—using the json.load() function. 
    <pre>
        import json

def read_json_from_file(filepath):
	with open(filepath, "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f) 
    </pre>
