     My favorite book is "One Indian Girl" by Chetan Bhagat, a compelling exploration of modern Indian society through the eyes of its protagonist, Radhika. 
       The novel intricately weaves her personal and professional struggles, addressing societal expectations, gender norms, and the pursuit of individual dreams.
         Chetan Bhagat's narrative skill captures the complexities of a woman's journey, offering a thought-provoking commentary on contemporary issues with a perfect blend of humor and depth.
          This female-centric novel not only entertains but also prompts reflection on evolving societal dynamics.
             Its exploration of feminism and identity makes it a standout piece in contemporary Indian literature.

            Sanam Teri Kasam is among my best films.
            The movie looks at issues like love, giving, and conformity to social norms.
             As the protagonists work through difficulties and roadblocks in their relationship, the audience is taken on an emotional rollercoaster. 
            "I swear by you, my beloved," is how the movie's title "Sanam Teri Kasam" conveys the deep and enduring quality of the love it portrays.
